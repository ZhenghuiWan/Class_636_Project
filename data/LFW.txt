Due to the huge size of datasset, I attached the link where I downloaded and used.

The Dataset we used for this task is Labeled Faces in the Wild Home, a labeled database of face photographs designed for 
studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition. The data set contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected 
from the web. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. At 5749 unique identities (and each identity 
may have one or more images) images, this dataset is really good for training.
