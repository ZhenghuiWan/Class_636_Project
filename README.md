# Class_636_Project

:smile: Welcome to my person identification project.

For the recent years, person identification/detection, as a branch of Objection Detection, became a heated issue. It contains many parts of topics, such as face recognition, human pose estimation, human segmentation ect. My project mainly focused on face detection of that part.

Deep into my task, it mainly involves two part: recognize where is a face and detect who is the face. While lots of great open sources reached a high performance, I get relative precise range of human face with the help of OpenCV, an mature open resource. The model was mainly built for recognize people who is it. Building my own model, I also want to do something on my own. Finally, I decided to build my personal face detection system.
